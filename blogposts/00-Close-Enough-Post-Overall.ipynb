      "Back in October, Greg Wilson [blogged about testing scientific software](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/10/why-we-dont-teach-testing.html). He specifically points to [a lesson introducing the Euler method](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc/blob/master/lessons/01_phugoid/01_03_PhugoidFullModel.ipynb) as part of the [Practical Numerical Methods with Python MOOC](http://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/GW/MAE6286/2014_fall/about), and asks why a certain number (the measured convergence rate) is *close enough* to the expected value.\n",
      "\n",
      "The big question of testing in scientific software, how this should be done, and how it is being done, has led to the [*Close Enough for Scientific Work*](https://github.com/swcarpentry/close-enough-for-scientific-work) project, as launched and explained by Greg Wilson in [this blog post](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/11/close-enough-for-scientific-work.html). If you're reading this, you should be following that project! As I've helped out on the MOOC, which is led by [Lorena Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/), I've been (over)thinking what sort of answer we could, or should, give. Well aware that we're heading for the [academic version of the balloon joke](https://www2.bc.edu/~radinr/Management_Humor/jokes.htm) (an answer that is correct, of little use, and took a long time to arrive), I've outlined some answers in the posts linked below."
